# eslint-plugin-react-you-might-not-need-an-effect/no-chain-state-updates

Demo project to showcase some violations from eslint-plugin-react-you-might-not-need-an-effect/no-chain-state-updates

No need to start project locally, main thing needed is just installing dependencies, and seeing ESLint warnings in IDE (once disabled comments are removed).
